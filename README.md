# LineEditor
This Program was done as practice for data structures and algorithms during my eduation. 

This code will implement a simple line editor, which is aimed to worked at the CMD, with a lot of user friendly and handling of entry errors.

Used data structuers: 
1- ArrayList:
To provide easy and simple indexing to specific lines, it stores lines which are represented by a Linked-list.
2- Linked-lists:
Used to process a line, by represeting each character in a linked-list, it makes interacting with characters and editing (i.e; using E command) much efficent.
